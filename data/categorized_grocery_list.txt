Here is your grocery item classification with sorted lists under their respective categories:

**Produce (Fresh Vegetables/ Fruits):**
- Apples
- Bell Peppers
- Broccoli
- Carrots
- Lettuce
- Mushrooms
- Onions
- Oranges* (*Assuming that "Orange Juice" was meant to be classified under produce, it typically consists of fresh or frozen orange content.)
- Spinach
- Strawberries
- Tomatoes

**Dairy:**
- Butter
- Eggs
- Greek Yogurt* (*Assuming that "Yogurt" refers to a dairy product like yogurt and not something else such as marshmallow cream.)
- Milk (assumed)

**Meat:**
- Chicken Breast
- Ground Beef
- Shrimp
- Salmon
- Sausages

*Note that "Eggs" can fall under both Dairy and Meats, but they are often listed separately in the meat section. If it's specifically for dairy products made from eggs like mayonnaise or egg whites used to make meringue, those should be included here instead of with meats:
- Egg Whites (assumed if needed)
  
**Bakery/ Bread Products:**
- Bread* (*Assuming 'bread' refers generically as no specific type is given.)

**Cereals and Grains:**
- Cereal
- Oatmeal
- Pasta (assumed)
- Rice (if not considered a grain, it could also fit into produce due to the context of being freshly harvested rice which may be available in some regions.)

*Assuming that "Tea" and "Coffee," though consumed as drinks similar to sodas or juices might belong together with Beverages:
- Coffee (assumed)
  
**Beverages/ Dairy Product Drinks:**
- Milk
- Orange Juice* (*Assuming here that this is fresh orange content and not processed milk beverage.)

**Canned or Processed Goods:**
- Almond Butter (assumed)
  
(If we consider "Orange" rather than as a standalone item, it should fall under produce with the above listings. If 'orange' is referring to anything else like canned fruit sections were not listed.)

*Processed or packaged items such as:
- Jam (assumed)
  
**Snacks and Condiments:**
- Chips
- Cookies/Chocolate pieces (Assuming 'chocolate' refers to baked goods, it is usually categorized with other sweets.)
*Note that the list included specific items like "Peanut Butter," which could be considered a spread and thus might fall under either Dairy or Specialty Foods depending on whether creamy peanut butter (which contains oil) was intended rather than chunkier varieties with less fat. Here, it's placed in the Snacks category for simplicity:
- Peanut Butter* (*Assuming that 'Peanut Butter' refers to a conventional spread and not specialty or natural peanut butters.)
  
**Other Nonperishables (assumed here):**
- Honey
- Pasta Sauce/Tomato Products, assuming "Jam" was meant as such. Otherwise, if 'jam' refers to canned fruit preserves without tomato content it should be listed separately under Canned Goods: 
    - Jam (assumed)
  
**Toiletries and Household Items:**
- Toilet Paper* (*Assuming "toilet paper" is meant in its typical form, not something like bidets or handmade papers.)
- Dish Soap
- Laundry Detergent (These are all common household cleaning items)
  
(If there were specific brands for any of these generic products mentioned such as "Tide," then it would be appropriate to sort them under the correct brand within their categories. Otherwise, they have been listed by type only.) 

This categorization has assumed typical interpretations and made some assumptions based on context; however, please note that certain items could potentially fit into more than one category depending upon specific product details (like "Orange Juice," which is usually not a dairy item but might be mislabeled). Additionally, the absence of explicit categories like 'Bakery' or clear distinction between different types within general food groups may require further clarification for precise sorting.

(Note: It seems there were some ambiguities in your list with items such as "Tea" and without specific products to consider sugar varieties etc., I had made certain assumptions based on common usage.)
